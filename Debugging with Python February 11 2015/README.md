**_What is debugging?_Â **

- Observing the state of your program near bugs so you know what's going on
- Finding where your code diverges from your mental model
- **_How do we avoid bugs in the first place?_**
- Write small pieces of functionality and test often.
- **_Debugging Tools_:**

- Simple Techniques
    - print statements
    - asserts
    - console reading

- ipython + pdb
    - Brief overview of what ipython is
    - How to start debugger: %run -d filename
    - Commands
        - h (help)
            - h (command name)

        - s(tep)
            - advance one line

        - pp
            - pretty print an expression

        - b(reak)
            - You can give it a line number or a function name
            - No arguments lists the breakpoints

        - a(rgs)
            - show the args of the current function

        - c(ont(inue))
            - Keep running until the next breakpoint (or the program ends)

        - cl(ear)
            - clears a breakpoint, given a bp number

        - l(ist)
            - Show the lines of code around the current one
