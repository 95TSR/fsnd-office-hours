# Office Hangouts 2/9/15 Summary:

Hello everyone! First office hours for the Fullstack Nanodegree Program!

We answered many questions about the program itself and ran out of time before talking about Project 1, but fear not, I've gone ahead and included that information in this summary.

Before talking about Project 1, I'm going to recap what questions were asked and what answers were provided.

## Question/Answer Summary:

#### Question 1:
Can one start with Project 3 or is there some material missing (in the fullstack-nanodegree-vm repo)? Thank you.

Answer: You are more than welcome to start with Project 3, but you may not have all the resources or all the foundational knowledge to complete it. If you feel comfortable with the material, you are more than welcome to start with any project that you wish. Keep in mind, however, that they do build in intensity. As a side note, the Auth and Auth course, which is considered a supplemental course to complete Project 3, is not currently available, but should be out soon.

#### Question 2:
How soon? (Auth and Auth course)

Answer: Soon! We don't have an exact date quite yet, but we are actively working on the course, and will launch it soon.

#### Question 3:
Question regarding one-on-one sessions; how do you schedule one, if you need to, thanks!

Answer: More information will be coming out as the program continues to progress. There will be an e-mail or a forum post that will explain the process and the guidelines of 1:1 appointments. To put it in a nutshell, however, there will be a link to a calendar with appointment slots. You can choose a slot and sign up for it.

We encourage 1:1 appointments, especially if you are confused or if you have a specific question.

#### Question 4:
Can we use CGI strips in Project 1 to make the whole website dynamic?

Answer: That's a great question! The short answer is YES! As long as you meet the requirements on the rubric for Project 1, you are more than welcome to make the page your own. If you want to play with the front-end portion of the assignment, you are more than welcome to do so.

You will also not be required to host the files online and will be turning in the actual Python file to the portal.

When completing Project 1, please keep in mind that Project 1 was designed to help students gain foundational knowledge in object-oriented Python programming by creating classes and objects. Once you have met this goal, the front-end (HTML, CSS, making the page dynamic, etc.) are your playground.

#### Question 5:
Can we use the Flask Framework?

Answer: We will actually be introducing the Flask Framework in Project 3 in Fullstack Foundations. We chose this framework for this Nanodegree program so if you already know Flask and would like to use Flask for your project, you are more than welcome to do so.

#### Question 8:
What is your strategy with the Nanodegrees you currently offer? How does this course fit within that strategy? Fullstack has become a buzz word nowadays like HTML5. Please elaborate on what you'd really like us to accomplish within the coursework.

Answer: By fullstack, we're focusing on the server side of the web application. You're going to learn how to build applications to put it as simple as possible. You're going to use some current tools used in industry nowadays to learn how applications are created and then put up on the web. You'll also be learning how to maintain applications and also how applications communicate with their users.

You'll also learn how databases work, how to communicate with databases, and how to retrieve information from databases. This program will be teaching you how a website interacts with its users through these different technologies.

Later on you'll also be learning authentication and authorization and Linux. These projects/courses will teach you how to keep your web applications and your users' data stable and secure.

#### Question 7:
I was able to submit Project 1, but can't submit Project 2. The Udacity GitLab keeps giving an error: "The change you wanted was rejected." Is this intentional or should I be able to submit?

Answer: You can place this on the forum or e-mail us at support@udacity.com with the question, the error you're getting, and any other information that you think may be helpful as it may require context for us to help figure out what's going on.

#### Question 8:
Project 1 was basically already made for us if we copied what the teacher did in the Python Foundation course. Can we expect the other projects to be a little more challenging?

Answer: Yes! Project 1 was designed for an introductory course where you are first introduced to the idea of object-oriented programming, and the project reflects that it is an introduction.

Definitely expect projects that are more complex and difficult as you progress through the Fullstack Nanodegree program!

#### Question 9:
Does the database have to be relational vs noSQL, for example?

Answer: The course is based on relational databases, but as long as you are in line with the rubric you should be okay if you choose to use another type of database. It would be best to mention that you used a database other than relational databases in the README file.

#### Question 10:
Is there a minimum amount of time after one can submit projects, get reviewed, and finally graduate? I already know a lot of stuff and feel lucky!

Answer: You can begin submitting projects when you are ready. If you feel as though you can do all five projects at once, then by all means please submit! When you finish one project, while you are waiting for the evaluation, go ahead and get started on the next project. We do ask that students pay for two months before graduating.

#### Question 11: Is it possible to submit multiple versions of the same project within the deadlines?

Answer: If you mean if you receive an evaluation that was Meets Specifications, but would like to resubmit to receive Exceeds Specifications, the answer would be no. We do not re-evaluate projects that have already met specifications. We encourage you to be happy with your project before you submit. If you don't want to miss a deadline, then submit to receive the Meets Specifications, but keep on working on your project afterwards! This project will go into your portfolio that employers can see so definitely make improvements on your project afterwards as well.

If you don't meet specifications, we encourage you to make the changes required and resubmit! The project evaluation process is more about improving your project rather than saying it does not pass so please take the feedback we provide to improve your project and resubmit until it's just right.

#### Question 12:
Are the forums live for this class? I get a 404 from the "Go to the forums" button for this course. I think Udacity hates me :(

Answer: The forums are live. If you're receiving an error you may want to check to see if there are any firewalls (especially if you're at work) which may be blocking the forums from loading. Try different browsers to see if it's browser related. If you don't find a solution, please e-mail support@udacity.com as well.

#### Question 13:
Please explain the rubric you refer to. Does that equal the project details or is there something else written?

Answer: The rubric are in the portal under Project Details. When you click Project Details, it will take you to several pages that include the information you need including a rubric. You can click between these pages using the Next button or by clicking on the node on the menu bar at the top of the classroom.

#### Question 14:
Is any course going to cover how to deploy a fullstack application to the internet?

Answer: Yes, Projects 4 and Project 5 will teach you how to deploy. We'll be using Google App Engine, but there are many resources out there, such as Heroku, that can be used to deploy your applications as well.

#### Question 15:
How can I launch my Python programs when using Sublime Text? like the counterpart to the "Run Module" command in IDLE. You can use Build (cmd + b) to open simple scripts through Sublime.

Answer: The best way would be to use Terminal/command line. If you navigate to the directory (or folder) that contains your Python file, you can write python filename.py, which will open your Python file.

#### Question 16:
How are you confident in Python in terms of potential employability?

Answer: In the long run, the actual programming language itself is not that important. If you fully understand the concepts and can demonstrate that in an interview, you should be in good shape. We chose Python because it is beginner and user friendly and because it is somewhat widely used. If you understand the fundamentals in Python, it becomes much easier to learn another language as at that point you are learning syntax more so than the fundamentals.

#### Question 17:
Any advice on how to approach your learning model? The first project I could have built the first day, but went through the course anyway to soak up as much material as possible. Basically trying to figure out how to get the full learning experience.

Answer: What you're doing is great! Take the courses, check out any supplemental resources we provide you and then put it into practice with your project.

#### Question 18:
Where can I find the recorded events? I can only see the latest one on the nanodegree main page. Also do the office hours get recorded?

Answer: You can find the recorded events in the Events section. Every Hangouts is recorded and kept in the Google Group Community. Currently because this is the first office hours we've had so far, this will be the only video that shows.

#### Question 19:
Hope this wasn't asked 40 times already. Is there an issue with using Python 3 in the projects?

Answer: There is no issue. We just ask students to keep in mind that there will be discrepancies between examples we show you in our classes and how to recreate it using Python 3, but otherwise there is no problem at all!

#### Question 20:
Who grades the projects?

Answer: The projects are graded by an amazing team of graders who are knowledgeable professionals with a lot of experience in fullstack web development. The projects are also reviewed by the coaches here at Udacity as well.

#### Question 21:
I read somewhere that nanodegrees could help students getting scholarships. Is that true?

Answer: We have a section on scholarships here: www.udacity.com/nanodegrees. Some of our partner companies are currently in the process of offering scholarships and internships to our students.

## Fullstack Nanodegree Overview:
Some of you may be wondering what is fullstack and what will I be learning in this program? This program was designed with industry professionals to teach budding developers how to develop and maintain everything across the stack starting from the server side. Fullstack refers to developers who have an understanding of every layer of a web application starting from the server, to the database, to the user interface, and the web page itself.

The Nanodegree programs were designed to be project-based learning, and I'm sure that some of you may have wondered, what does that mean, what would be expected of us for project-based learning.

At Udacity, we believe in learning by doing so we designed the Nanodegrees to be a series of projects, and as you complete each project, we've provided resources to help you learn the skills to complete that project. Each project introduces a new concept while also utilizing concepts that you've learned in previous projects.

You will be completing 5 projects throughout the course of this program.

#### Project 1: Movie Trailer Website
The purpose of this project will be to, as mentioned above, learn object-oriented Python programming. This will help you become more familiar with object-oriented programming as well as the Python programming language. I will discuss Project 1 in more detail below.

#### Project 2: Tournament Results
The purpose of this project will be to learn how to design, create, and utilize databases to store, manipualte, and read information. This is important because in order for a website to be dynamic and data-driven, it needs to have a way to store and access that data even after the program ends. By learning how to use databases, you'll be able to create websites that allow users to sign up, store information on their profiles, and interact with the data of a website in a variety of ways.

#### Project 3: Item Catalog
Project 3 builds on Project 2 in that if Project 2 was more about building and querying a database, Project 3 brings in more interaction between the user and the website. You will be using databases again to create an application where users can register and have the ability to post, edit, and delete their own items. This is important because now that we know how to store persistent data in our databases, this project will help us learn how to allow users to efficiently interact with that data. This project will also begin to apply security measures to web applications through the use of authenitcation mechanisms and by mapping HTTP methods to CRUD operations.

#### Project 4: Conference Organization App
Now that we've learned how to store and manipulate our information in databases and allow users to interact with our website, we'll learn how to host a web application on a cloud-based API server to create a conference organization application. This web app will authenticate users, create user profiles, and query the database for conference information. By learning how to host our website on a cloud-based service, we are able to host and maintain a website on a massive scale.

#### Project 5: Linux Server Configuration
Last, but not least, we will be learning how to use Linux. The purpose of this project will be to help you learn how to take a new Linux server and turn it into a secure and efficient web application host for your applications. This will be the final project to help you learn how to deploy web applications to a publicly accessible server and how to properly secure your application.

There will be three big due dates for the five projects. The first deadline will be for Projects 1 and 2 on April 27th. We will be sending out friendly weekly e-mails with pacing tips and advice.

Some of you may be wondering, what happens if I'm not quite on schedule. The good news is that we designed these programs to be self-pacing meaning that the deadlines are set up as more as guidelines. If you are ahead of schedule, keep going! We estimate the program to take about 9 months, but there are students who have finished the Front-end Nanodegree Program in about 3 months, and you are more than welcome to do so for the Fullstack Nanodegree Program as well!

If you are behind schedule, don't worry. If you can't make a deadline, you'll be moved into the cohort behind you. We do this so that the discussions and the community reflect where you currently are and are more relevant to your current project. There is nothing wrong with being moved back a cohort at any deadline point in time! If you have any questions, feel free to post them on our forum.

## Project 1 Overview:

Now that we have some of the logistics of the program out of the way, let's talk about Project 1! As mentioned above, Project 1 is to biuld a Movie Trailer Website where users can see your favorite movies and watch the trailer.

You'll be writing server side code to store a list of movie titles, box art/poster images, and movie trailer URLs. The data will then be expressed on the web page and allow users to review the movies and watch the trailers. (Here's a hint: The data for the movies will be stored using Classes!)

Again, as mentioned above, you'll be learning how to write an application using object-oriented Python programming as well as how to serve HTML using a web server and how web servers receive requests, execute a block of code, and generate a response.

To complete this project, you will have to make sure that you have Python downloaded on your computer. You may use Python 3, but keep in mind that we are going to be using Python 2. While this shouldn't be too problematic, Python 3 is not backwards compatible and you will be responsible to figure out any discrepancies.

You will also need to download the file fresh_tomatoes.py which contains the open_movies_page function that will take in your list of movies to create an HTML file to showcase your favorite movies.

The Programming Foundations with Python course will help you get started.

NOTE: Because this project is a part of the Programming Foundations with Python course, if you have successfully completed the project before, please e-mail us at fullstack-project@udacity.com

### Project Evaluation (Rubric):

The project will be evaluated on a Does Not Meet Specifications, Meets Specifications, and Exceeds Specifications scale. While every criteria will have a does not meet and meets category, not every criteria will have an exceeds option.

The rubric is broken into four major categories.

#### Functionality:
Does your project work the way it's supposed to? Are movies and their poster images being displayed on the web page? Is there a trailer link? Does it open from the Python file error free?

If you would like to exceed specifications, add more information about the movies, such as the actors, the release date, trivia, etc. or play around with the HTML and the CSS to redo the format and styling of the page.

#### Code Quality:
Is your code organized and professional? If you need an idea of how to format and style your code to look organized and professional, check out the Google Python Style Guide and the PEP-8 site:

https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

Because Python is sensitive to white space and indents, mae sure that you follow the formatting rules found here.

#### Comments:
Do you use comments to describe what is going on in your code? Would other developers be able to take a look at your code and easily be able to understand what your code is trying to do? A good starting to see how to comment code would be to take a look at the comments section of the Google Python Style Guide.

#### Documentation:
When submitting your project, be sure to include a README file deatiling how a user is to run your project (how to open the movie trailer website).

Include information, such as, how do they get your code (download, etc.), are there any requirements?, and are there any commands that need to be run in order to run your application?

A good example to get you started (provided by a current student on the forum) is the README file for bootstrap: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap#quick-start

While this example is a bit extensive, it gives you an idea of what the purpose of a README file would be. README files are great because when there are programs that have a lot of interconnecting files or are new, README files provide instructions to other users on how to run your program.

Hope this answers some of the questions you may have and to get started on Project 1!
